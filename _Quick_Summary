(11)	SIGIR2013 - SESSION Recommender systems - Improve collaborative filtering through bordered block diagonal form matrices
The CF framework based on (A)BBDF structures of rating matrices proposed in this paper is capable of combining the advantages of community detection and matrix clustering techniques as well as making use of various CF algorithms. An important advantage of this framework is that it does not rely on a specific CF algorithm. Any CF algorithm that is based on rating matrices can be integrated into this framework, such as User-based, Item-based, SVD and NMF. Experimental results show that this framework helps these CF algorithms to improve the prediction accuracy and, at the same time, benefits system scalability.

[ABSTRACT] We adapt the proportional hazards modeling approach in survival analysis to the recommendation research field and propose a new opportunity model to explicitly incorporate time in an e-commerce recommender system. The new model estimates the joint probability of a user making a follow-up purchase of a particular product at a particular time.

[INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION] From content-based, a system’s follow-up recommendation should include camera accessories instead of similar cameras. We extend the proportional hazards model in statistics with the hierarchical Bayesian framework as part of the solution, and derive detailed inference steps based on the variational Bayesian algorithm.
[RELATED WORK] There are two major recommendation approaches: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.
In the field of recommender systems, the effect of time [10, 18, 24] has received some research attention recently. One focus is about the drift of the user’s preference over time [10, 23, 15]. Koren [10] revamped two popular collaborative filtering methods by modeling the time drifting factor of user preferences. Rendel et al. [15] proposed a factorized personalized model that subsumes both a common Markov chain and the normal matrix factorization model.
Some recent work studied modeling the time interval between purchase orders in the e-commerce domain [18, 24]. Wang et al. [18] discovered different postpurchase behavior in different time windows after purchasing. Zhao et al. [24] used the purchasing time interval to improve the temporal diversity of recommendations [15]. The time interval and the corresponding purchase probability is modeled inside the framework of a utility-based recommender system [19].
Our work explicitly models the joint probability of purchasing the product at the time based on a solid theoretical foundation. We explicitly model the conditional probability as a white box by leveraging Weibull distribution with various covariates to estimate the time-based probabilistic density.
[DataSet] The purchase history from 2004-01-01 to 2009-03-08 collected on a real-world e-commerce website, shop.com, is used for our experiments.
Tail users that made less than 5 product purchases are filtered out in the training data, which follows the similar pre-processing in related work [19, 24]. In addition, 10 possible spam users that made more than 200 product purchases are filtered out as well.

We develop a recommender system that allows users to provide feedback on the recommended items. Based on the feedback, we incrementally update the users’ profile to generate a new list of recommendations. Experiment results on the Movielens dataset show that the proposed approach is able to increase the acceptance rate of recommendations and improve user satisfaction.
(15)	SIGIR2013 - SESSION Short papers 2 - social media IR - Informational friend recommendation in social media
Differing from traditional methods, we propose to recommend friends that can better satisfy users’ unfulfilled informational need, which is called informational friend recommendation. For this purpose, we need to first mine users’ informational need. Here we consider users’ unfulfilled informational need as the posts one may be interested in but are unable to obtained from his/her current friends so far, and mine such information with CF methods. We then introduce a quantity named informational utility, which stands for the degree to which a friend satisfies the target user’s unfulfilled informational need. Finally, we rank all the friend candidates by high informational utility for recommendation.
(16)	SIGIR2013 - SESSION Social media and network analysis I - An experimental study on implicit social recommendation
When the explicit social information is not available, we evaluate all the algorithms on two popular datasets: MovieLens1 and EachMovie2. The MovieLens dataset we adopt in this paper is a relatively small dataset contains 100,000 user-item ratings (scale from 1 to 5) rated by 943 users on 1,642 items. The EachMovie data set is a relatively large dataset includes 74,424 users, 1,648 movies, and 2,811,718 ratings in the range from 0 to 5.
(17)	SIGIR2013 - SESSION Time - Modeling user's receptiveness over time for recommendation
Let us consider the snapshots of users’ item ratings and their social relationships at time points T1 and T2 in Figure 1. Suppose our target user is U2. At time point T1, both users U1 and U2 have watched and rated the movie “Movie2”. Traditional CF methods [15, 16, 13] will group U1 and U2 as similar users and recommend “Movie1” to U2 since U1 has watched“Movie1”previously. Yet, U2’s interest does not remain static. We observe that at time point T2, his interest has shifted from movies to kids as he rates a new item“Kids1”.

It is impractical to apply a supervised learning approach to the raw data because of its sparsity. As a result, some researchers focused on profile analytics data and attribute reduction techniques to lower the dimensionality of the data. In [11] some generic detection attributes and model-specific detection attributes are proposed. In this paper, we use two generic attributes to detect group shilling attacks.

As demonstrated by extensive experiments on large scale real-world social networks, IMRank always achieves high accuracy comparable to greedy algorithms, while the computational cost is reduced dramatically, about 10 − 100 times faster than other scalable heuristics.

We observed that the performance of existing recommendation systems in unexplored categories drops significantly compared to that in explored categories. Based on our analysis, the performance drop is mainly caused by the fact that user preference on products is hard to transfer across different categories. After suverying several factors, we find out that price is a factor that is transferrable across categories. We choose price for several other reasons as well: it is one of the most important factors that users consider 667in making purchase decisions and it is available on almost all E-commerce websites.

(28)	SIGIR2015 - SESSION Session 4C Classifying & Ranking - Listwise Collaborative Filtering
Recently, ranking-oriented collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms have achieved great success in recommender systems. They obtained state-of-the-art performances by estimating a preference ranking of items for each user rather than estimating the absolute ratings on unrated items (as conventional rating-oriented CF algorithms do). In this paper, we propose a new ranking-oriented CF algorithm, called ListCF.
Different from rating-oriented CF, ranking-oriented CF [18] directly predicts a preference ranking of items for each user. Similarly, ranking-oriented CF algorithms can be also categorized into memory-based ranking-oriented CF [15, 27] and model-based ranking-oriented CF [10, 20, 25].
*(29)	SIGIR2015 - SESSION Session 5B Products - Learning Hierarchical Representation Model for NextBasket Recommendation
[ABSTRACT] Ideally, a good recommender should be able to explore the sequential behavior (i.e., buying one item leads to buying another next), as well as account for users’ general taste (i.e., what items a user is typically interested in) for recommendation. Moreover, these two factors may interact with each other to influence users’ next purchase. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation approach, namely hierarchical representation model (HRM)

[General Terms] Algorithms, Experiments, Performance, Theory
[Keywords] Hierarchical Representation Model; Sequential Behavior; General Taste; Next Basket Recommendation
[INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION] In this task, usually sequential transaction data is given per user, where a transaction is a set/basket of items (e.g. shoes or bags) bought at one point of time. The target is to recommend items that the user probably want to buy in his/her next visit.
One is sequential recommender [5, 25], mostly relying on Markov chains, which explores the sequential transaction data by predicting the next purchase based on the last actions. A major advantage of this model is its ability to capture sequential behavior for good recommendations, e.g. for a user who has recently bought a mobile phone, it may recommend accessories that other users have bought after buying that phone.
The other is general recommender [1, 23], which discards any sequential information and learns what items a user is typically interested in. One of the most successful methods in this class is the model based collaborative filtering (i.e. matrix factorization models). Obviously, such general recommender is good at capturing the general taste of the user by learning over the user’s whole purchase history.
FPMC -> independent assumption is not sufficient for good recommendations. -> HRM
HRM allows us to flexibly use different types of aggregation operations at different layers. Especially, by employing nonlinear rather than linear operations, we can model more complicated interactions among different factors beyond independent assumption

(33)	SIGIR2015 - SESSION Short Papers - Personalized Semantic Ranking for Collaborative Recommendation
Recently a ranking view of collaborative recommendation has received much attention in recommendation systems. Most of existing ranking approaches are based on pairwise assumption, i.e., everything that has not been selected is of less interest for a user. However it is usually not proper in many cases. To alleviate the limitation of this assumption, in this work, we present a unified framework, named Personalized Semantic Ranking (PSR). PSR models the personalized ranking and the user-generated content (UGC) simultaneously, and the semantic information extracted from UGC can make a remedy for the pairwise assumption. Moreover, utilizing the semantic information, PSR can capture the more subtle information of the user-item interaction and alleviate the overfitting problem caused by insufficient ratings. The learned topics in PSR can also serve as proper explanations for recommendation. Experimental results show that the proposed PSR yields significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on two typical datasets.
(34)	SIGIR2015 - SESSION Short Papers - Reducing Hubness - A Cause of Vulnerability in Recommender Systems
Shilling attacks inject recommendation systems with fake users in order to force the systems to generate biased recommendations [3, 1]. By design, memory-based CF issues recommendations based on the past responses to items by other users, rather than the individual to whom the recommendation is made.
(35)	SIGIR2015 - SESSION Short Papers - When Personalization Meets Conformity - Collective Similarity based Multi-Domain Recommendation
In fact, if a user has significant similar behaviors to a large number of other users, she/he is probably the elite user who can represent others. To this end, a domainspecific user similarity matrix based on observed behaviors is built to embody conformity. On the other hand, since users’ intrinsic preferences over domains are also decisive, a domain-shared user similarity matrix is utilized to profile users globally. Therefore, a collective similarity combining the effect of conformity with the original personalization is established.

(36)	SIGIR2016 - SESSION Recommendation Systems I - Discrete Collaborative Filtering
We argue that such a scheme will result in a large quantization loss, which especially compromises the performance of large-scale CF that resorts to longer binary codes. In this paper, we propose a principled CF hashing framework called Discrete Collaborative Filtering (DCF), which directly tackles the challenging discrete optimization that should have been treated adequately in hashing. The formulation of DCF has two advantages: 1) the Hamming similarity induced loss that preserves the intrinsic user-item similarity, and 2) the balanced and uncorrelated code constraints that yield compact yet informative binary codes.

[INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION] Several observations can be made. First, items with small SF (i.e., frequently accessed), small SR (i.e., recently accessed), and small Dissim (genre has been frequently and recently accessed) have small Nov values and thus are less novel.
[RELATED WORK] There are several differences between CBRS and existing DORSs and PPBRS.

[Measurement] Novelty Fitness, Recommendation Precision, Inter User Similarity
Traditional recommendation systems (RSs) aim to recommend items that are relevant to the user’s interest. Unfortunately, the recommended items will soon become too familiar to the user and hence fail to arouse her interest. Discovery-oriented recommendation systems (DORSs) complement accuracy with discover utilities (DUs) such as novelty and diversity and optimize the tradeoff between the DUs and accuracy of the recommendations. Unfortunately, DORSs ignore an important fact that different users have different appetites for DUs. That is, highly curious users can accept highly novel and diversified recommendations whereas conservative users would behave in the opposite manner.

*(38)	SIGIR2016 - SESSION Recommendation Systems II - Collaborative Filtering Bandits
[ABSTRACT] Classical collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering methods try to learn a static recommendation model given training data. These approaches are far from ideal in highly dynamic recommendation domains such as news recommendation and computational advertisement, where the set of items and users is very fluid.
In this work, we investigate an adaptive clustering technique for content recommendation based on exploration-exploitation strategies in contextual multi-armed bandit settings.

In this work, we propose a novel model, Dynamic REcurrent bAsket Model (DREAM), based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). DREAM not only learns a dynamic representation of a user but also captures global sequential features among baskets.
The dynamic representation of a specific user can reveal user’s dynamic interests at different time, and the global sequential features reflect interactions of all baskets of the user over time.

Our method is based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering (average linkage) and we also report the performance of other linkage criteria that measure the distance between two clusters of query-document pairs. Another difference from previous hierarchical clustering is that we cluster the instances belonging to the same query, which usually outperforms the baselines.

[ABSTRACT] In this paper, we show the deficiencies of popular evaluation techniques of diversification methods, and investigate multiple relevance and diversity measures to understand whether they have any correlations. 
Next, we propose a novel measure called expanded relevance which combines both relevance and diversity into a single function in order to measure the coverage of the relevant part of the graph. 
We also present a new greedy diversification algorithm called BestCoverage, which optimizes the expanded relevance of the result set with (1−1/e)-approximation.

[INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION] Algorithms developed for graph-based recommendation are very popular among web services; for instance, Amazon uses co-purchasing information to recommend products to its customers, IMDB recommends movies to its visitors based on the information such as director, cast, and ratings, and Google uses the web-graph and the user histories for personalized web search.
In this work, we assume that the graph itself is the only information we have, and no categories or intents are available. We are interested in providing recommendations based on a set of objects of interest.
As the first contribution, we show that such an evaluation is inappropriate. Indeed, we design query-oblivious algorithms

[INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION] Although collaborative filtering has become the standard method for the recommendation problem, traditional recommender systems only use ratings of relevant users/items to make recommendations without taking into account any other information. This trait, when information volume becomes larger and larger, poses crucial challenges such as data sparsity (i.e., insufficient similar users/items can be found), low recommendation quality (due to data sparsity, as well as homogeneity of the information source), etc.
In order to handle the issues of traditional recommendation models, recently, two trends in the community of recommender systems have attracted a lot of attention: (1) Contextual information (e.g., time, location, mood, weather, etc.) (2) The fast growth of online social networks has brought another trend of so called social1 recommendation
[RELATED WORK] Matrix factorization / Context-aware recommender systems / Social recommendation
[DataSet] MovieLens-1M dataset / Douban7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books, movies and music. Each user can provide ratings (ranging from one star to five stars) to books, movies and music, indicating his/her preference on the item. A timestamp is associated with a rating. A user, although has not consumed an item (i.e., no rating is provided), may still express his/her interest by indicating “wish” (e.g., wish to read the book).

MPUM considers what the users already have when recommending additional products. We evaluate MPUM against several popular recommendation algorithms on two real-world E-commerce datasets. Results confirm the underlying economic intuition, and show that MPUM significantly outperforms the comparison algorithms under top-K evaluation metrics.

Learning users’ preferences is critical to enable personalized recommendation services. In this paper, we study on how to learn users’ preferences from abundant online activities, e.g., browsing and examination, which are usually called implicit feedbacks since they cannot be interpreted as users’ likes or dislikes on the corresponding products directly. Pairwise preference learning algorithms are the state-of-the-art methods for this important problem, but they have two major limitations of low accuracy and low efficiency caused by noise in observed feedbacks and non-optimal learning steps in update rules.

Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) help improve the effectiveness of recommendations by adapting to users’ preferences in different contextual situations.
The fundamental assumption of CARS is that a rating for an item is a function not just of the user and the item, but also of the context in which the item is evaluated or used. User’s preferences on a given item may vary from context to context. For example, companion is an influential context in the movie domain; you may make a different decision in selecting movies if you intend to watch the movie on a date, than if you plan on seeing a movie with children.
